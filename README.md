## About

ARM is an open source, Discord bot that is constantly growing with features. It comes packaged with a variety of commands.

## Commands

 - **ping** - a command which responds with the latency of the bot in your server
 - **args-info** - a command which responds with the number of arguments you used

## Installation

    The bot is still in it's early coding stage, so there is no way to add it to your server yet

## Help

If you have any questions about the bot or the code you can raise an issue above or join the official ARM Discord.
